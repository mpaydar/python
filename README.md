## Random_generator1.py: 
Two functions are implemented : 

@ random_integer(n,m) ; n is the size of the list & m is the stop point of the random built-in function. 
first function is initializing a list specified by user via the "n" variable, then it  generates random integer ranging from 1 to m and get the list populate. For observation, the populating process happens 3 times.

Second function:
The only difference is that this function does not produce any duplicate so every single number that is put in the list in an unique value.
